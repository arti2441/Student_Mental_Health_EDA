# Student_Mental_Health_EDA
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a student mental health dataset. 
The analysis focuses on understanding demographic, academic, and lifestyle patterns and their 
associations with depression among students. The goal is to identify meaningful trends, highlight 
potential risk factors, and practice structured EDA techniques using real-world data.
